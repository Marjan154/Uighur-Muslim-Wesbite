# Uighur Muslim Project

This website is intended to raise awareness about the injustices of the detained Muslims in China. Through the use of fonts/colors/animations of text and images, I hope to invoke the emotions of viewers that portray the graveness of the oppression of the Muslims in China. This website provides references to several articles and videos as resources to begin research. Hopefully raising awareness will encourage more and more people to stand up for Muslims, or atleast feel injustice for them, as every little change counts.
