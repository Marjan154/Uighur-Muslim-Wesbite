      The Xinjiang re-education camps (referred to by the government of the
      People's Republic of China as Vocational Education and Training
      Centers)[6][7][8] are concentration camps[4][9][10] that have been
      operated by the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Regional government for the
      purpose of interning Uyghur Muslims since 2014.[1] They have significantly
      intensified since a hardline party secretary, Chen Quanguo, took charge of
      the region in August 2016. These camps are reportedly operated outside of
      the legal system; many Uyghurs have reportedly been interned without trial
      and no charges have been levied against them.[2][11][12] Local authorities
      are reportedly holding hundreds of thousands of Uyghurs and Muslims from
      other ethnic minorities in these camps, for the stated purpose of
      countering extremism and terrorism.[13][14][15][16][17]
